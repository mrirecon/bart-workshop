The reason behind this is that Jupyter Notebooks are a great tool to combine code and markdown text in a single document, share them with others, and run them on online hosted services like Google Colab. It should be mentioned that most users of BART don't use Jupyter Notebooks, but rather write scripts to write their reconstruction pipelines.\n",
